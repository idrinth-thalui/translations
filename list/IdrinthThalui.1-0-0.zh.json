  "<font face='$HandwrittenFont'><b>Wolf Howling<b>\n\nDay 1\nI spend a long time this night listening to wolves and trying to imitate their howls. It is hard for my throat to form these sounds correctly.\n\nDay 4\nI had the first little success tonight I believe, at least one wolf stared at me from a save distance after I practised my howling.\n\nDay 5\nThe same wolf reappeared, this time coming closer. I will bring him some food tomorrow.\n\nDay 9\nThe wolf actually got himself the food, but stayed away from me. I guess I still seem to be too intimidating.\n\nDay 15\nI think I may have found the answer, adding a bit of alteration magic to my throat to howl. Today the wolf answered, howling with me.\n\nDay 32\nI think I'm getting the hang of it, calling my wolf friends works now almost at any time. My howl seems to be sufficiently close to theirs. That I add some meat as a reward for showing up certainly helps.\n[pagebreak]\n<b>Wolf Turning<b>\n\nDay 1\nAlteration seems like a perfect candidate for this, it allows me to hide my nature with  a mask already, so why shouldn't it allow for deeper changes?\n\nDay 2\nSo far no progress, I can not even seem to make fur appear. Will try mixing in blood into the spell, it should empower it.\n\nDay 7\nSome progress, I ended up walking around with fur on my hands for almost a day. Had to hide from a lot of people due to werewolf suspicion.\n\nDay 19\nWhile today was not as good as yesterday, I managed to reduce the magica cost for adding fur a bit by instead of making it from nothing  using the hair I already have as a baseline.\n\nDay 27\nI managed to give me a snout like a wolf, took a couple hours until it faded back. I certainly made the Khajiit barmaid scream, when I showed my teeth with a smile. Didn't intend for that to happen, she's fine again now, calmed down quickly after I explained what I was doing.\n\nDay 41\nI had to move to the wilderness to continue experimenting. Being half-wolf like for a few hours led to too many suspicions about a werewolf. I'm making progress at least.\n\nDay 58\nFinally something more wolf like, I've managed to get the claws, fur and basic body shape, now I just need to improve the casting time, magicka cost and the exact outcome.\n\nDay 79\nI think I turned into something close enough to a wolf today. It certainly didn't bother the actual wolves in my proximity, they reacted as they would have with any stray wolf.\n\nDay 94\nI managed to get the spell under control for now, should come in handy if I have to flee from a strong enemy.\n[pagebreak]\n<b>The Thu'um<b>\n\nDay 1\nI have arrived in Skyrim, the land of the famous Thu'um. It is cold and close to an open war with it's own population. I have not heard a mention of the Thu'um yet, is it a forgotten art?\n\nDay 6\nI've been told of the Graybeards, peaceful masters of the Thu'um. They don't quite match what I need, maybe I can get access to Ulfrik Stormcloak?\n\nDay 17\nWindhelm is by far to unfriendly to elves to stay there for long.

He seems to have about much interest in crows as I have in wolves. It is very entertaining to exchange stories with him about our misadventures.\nSadly there is no chance to meet in person, as I am currently in Hammerfell and he is stationed at home, on Summerset.\n[pagebreak]\n<b>Alenia</b>\n\nAlenia is a special one, she seems to have the same interest in greatswords, that I have.

I'm happy she is asking me for my opinions on Alteration magic, even if I'm sure she mastered it more than I ever could.

It's frustrating to both of us, especially since it comes so natural to me.\n[pagebreak]\n<b>Idileth the Crow</b>\n\nI am not quite sure what made him become such an enemy to me. He was asking simple questions, that I had simple answers for and somehow still preferred the Thalmor's rotten answers over the truth.
