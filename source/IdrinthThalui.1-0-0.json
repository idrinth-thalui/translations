It is hard for my throat to form these sounds correctly.\n\nDay 4\nI had the first little success tonight I believe, at least one wolf stared at me from a save distance after I practised my howling.\n\nDay 5\nThe same wolf reappeared, this time coming closer. I will bring him some food tomorrow.\n\nDay 9\nThe wolf actually got himself the food, but stayed away from me. I guess I still seem to be too intimidating.\n\nDay 15\nI think I may have found the answer, adding a bit of alteration magic to my throat to howl. Today the wolf answered, howling with me.\n\nDay 32\nI think I'm getting the hang of it, calling my wolf friends works now almost at any time. My howl seems to be sufficiently close to theirs. That I add some meat as a reward for showing up certainly helps.\n[pagebreak]\n<b>Wolf Turning<b>\n\nDay 1\nAlteration seems like a perfect candidate for this, it allows me to hide my nature with  a mask already, so why shouldn't it allow for deeper changes?\n\nDay 2\nSo far no progress, I can not even seem to make fur appear. Will try mixing in blood into the spell, it should empower it.\n\nDay 7\nSome progress, I ended up walking around with fur on my hands for almost a day. Had to hide from a lot of people due to werewolf suspicion.\n\nDay 19\nWhile today was not as good as yesterday, I managed to reduce the magica cost for adding fur a bit by instead of making it from nothing  using the hair I already have as a baseline.\n\nDay 27\nI managed to give me a snout like a wolf, took a couple hours until it faded back. I certainly made the Khajiit barmaid scream, when I showed my teeth with a smile. Didn't intend for that to happen, she's fine again now, calmed down quickly after I explained what I was doing.\n\nDay 41\nI had to move to the wilderness to continue experimenting. Being half-wolf like for a few hours led to too many suspicions about a werewolf. I'm making progress at least.\n\nDay 58\nFinally something more wolf like, I've managed to get the claws, fur and basic body shape, now I just need to improve the casting time, magicka cost and the exact outcome.\n\nDay 79\nI think I turned into something close enough to a wolf today. It certainly didn't bother the actual wolves in my proximity, they reacted as they would have with any stray wolf.\n\nDay 94\nI managed to get the spell under control for now, should come in handy if I have to flee from a strong enemy.\n[pagebreak]\n<b>The Thu'um<b>\n\nDay 1\nI have arrived in Skyrim, the land of the famous Thu'um. It is cold and close to an open war with it's own population. I have not heard a mention of the Thu'um yet, is it a forgotten art?\n\nDay 6\nI've been told of the Graybeards, peaceful masters of the Thu'um. They don't quite match what I need, maybe I can get access to Ulfrik Stormcloak?\n\nDay 17\nWindhelm is by far to unfriendly to elves to stay there for long. I will need to first make a name for myself and then try to befriend the jarl to learn from him.\n</font>"

Her main issue seems to be how distant and aloof her parents are. They likely desired a boy and aren't happy with a girl I'm guessing.\nI'll continue to write with her for sure, it's fun to have such a clean and pure mind to talk to.\n[pagebreak]\n<b>Xelian the Crow</b>\n\nXelian is a friendly one. He seems to have about much interest in crows as I have in wolves. It is very entertaining to exchange stories with him about our misadventures.\nSadly there is no chance to meet in person, as I am currently in Hammerfell and he is stationed at home, on Summerset.\n[pagebreak]\n<b>Alenia</b>\n\nAlenia is a special one, she seems to have the same interest in greatswords, that I have. I wonder if she'll find Trinimac as her major god as well. She'll certainly become a good warrior some day.\n[pagebreak]\n<b>Xinerna</b>\n\nI am quite sure Xinerna is one of the strangest, yet most brilliant minds I have encountered. I'm happy she is asking me for my opinions on Alteration magic, even if I'm sure she mastered it more than I ever could. It has been a few hundred years since we started, but somehow I fail to explain to her how to turn into a wolf. It's frustrating to both of us, especially since it comes so natural to me.\n[pagebreak]\n<b>Idileth the Crow</b>\n\nI am not quite sure what made him become such an enemy to me. He was asking simple questions, that I had simple answers for and somehow still preferred the Thalmor's rotten answers over the truth. I noticed him hunting me a few days ago, his smell is still very similar to my brother's. It seems he has also followed me to Skyrim, something I did not expect. I need to do something about him before he becomes a real problem, but on the other hand I don't want to harm family if I can help it.\n[pagebreak]\n<b>Calenith</b>\n\nCalenith should be one of my Great-Great-Great...Great-Niece, not quite sure how many \"Great\" it already has been. She has contacted me recently about a Bosmer lover of hers. I will write back a letter proposing for them to run to Skyrim, where the hold of the Aldmeri Dominion and the Thalmor is relatively weak and I can have a look out for them.\n</font>"
